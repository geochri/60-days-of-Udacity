### PYTHON BASICS
>One of the most fundamental steps of AI is learning
the right language for it. Python has been the most
used over R and C++ due to its simple syntax and
inter-package cooperation & availability.


Introduction to Python, The Scientific Libraries, Advanced Python Programming and the Pandas Section of Data and Empirics https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/

Chapters 1 - 4 https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/8a34a4f653bdbdc01415a94dc20d4e9b97438965/notebooks/Index.ipynb

Then this Pandas tutorial https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html

Here are some excellent pandas code examples https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book
